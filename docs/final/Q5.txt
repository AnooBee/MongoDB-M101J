Now suppose you want to run the following query against the collection.

db.stuff.find({'a':{'$lt':10000}, 'b':{'$gt': 5000}}, {'a':1, 'c':1}).sort({'c':-1})
Which of the indexes could be used by MongoDB to assist in answering the query? Check all that apply.


a_1_c_1
a_1_b_1_c_-1
c_1
a_1_b_1
_id_

query is on a,b and a,c; sort on c

a_1_c_1 -> a,c
a_1_b_1_c_1 -> a,b,c
c_1- > c
a_1_b_1 -> a,b

_id_ is only one not used.
