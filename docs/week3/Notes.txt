Schema Design:

Application driven schema ...data is modelled based on application; (different from RDBMS which is agnostic of application).

MongoDB:
- Rich documents
- Prejoin/embed data for fast access
- No Joins (hard to scale - joins has to be done within your app - or embed in doc)
- No constraints (No FK)
- Atomic operation; No Transactions
- No declared schema


3rd normal form: "[Every] non-key [attribute] must provide a fact about the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key

If MongoDB Schema begins to look like a RDBMS schema - probably doing it wrong.
